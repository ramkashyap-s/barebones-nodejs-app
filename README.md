# log-file-analyzer-pageviews

A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

This application supports the [Getting Started with Node on Heroku]

## Documentation

A file needs to be provided before Results button is clicked.

Hovering on donut chart displays the pageviews and user name in the centre of the donut/pie chart.

As this app is deployed using Heroku free account, if it doesn't receive traffic for 30 mins, the instance may sleep leading to slow response initially.

Due to ajax there is an error that is written to console, however this doesn't effect the accuracy as it is used for showing the percentage of the upload.

This app needs further development and is not checked for edge cases.
